This folder contains the Large Scale International Boundaries (LSIB) geospatial dataset (shapefile format in the "data" folder) and several related files to help make the data more usable.  These include GIS application files (ArcGIS Pro Map Package and QGIS map documents in the "apps" folder) and cartographic style files (.sld and .lyrx in the "styles" folder).  The intent is to help facilitate use of the LSIB data by providing specific cartographic examples of how to style the lines. This portion are beta releases provided on an as-is basis.
